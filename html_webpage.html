    <h1>Html Basics</h1>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>HTML is standard markup language for creating web pages developed by Tim Berners Lee in 1991.
        It is used by the browser to manipulate text, images and other content to display it in required 
        format. Each page contains a series of connection to other pages called hyperlinks.The html standard 
        and all other web related standaards are developed under the authoriity of the world wide web consortium (W3C).
        Standards, specifications, and draft ig ner proposals found at http://www.w3.org/.
        The most recent work is the HTML 4.0 specification, which is growing in support by major browsers.</p>

    <h1>Introduction to HTLM Basics</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages. 
        HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was 
        published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version 
        is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was 
        published in 2012.</p>
    <h1>Why to Learn HTML?</h1>

        and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers. Now, HTML is being widely used to 
        format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.</p>
